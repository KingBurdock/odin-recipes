    <h2>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (half pound ground pork, quarter pound lean ground beef).
         Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
         Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
         Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
         Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
         Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
         Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
         Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
         Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</ul>

        <b>Step 1:</b> 
                Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.

                <b>Step 2:</b>

            <P>
                <b>Step 3:</b>
                While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

                <b>Step 4</b>
                While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

                <b>Step 5</b>

                <b>Step 6</b>
                Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.

                Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
